# SlimFacebook
Do you find Facebook app uncomfortable?
It is too heavy, too slow, too energy-consumptive or with too permissions?

I don't use Facebook a lot so I wondered why I have to have their cumbersome app?
Obviously, I had tried Facebook Light but it was still too "intrusive" to my use.
For months I've only use the web version of Facebook using the browser but it was stressful because it usually opened a lot of tabs and it killed my battery.

I noticed that the web version of Facebook was complete and fast so I've thought:
"Why don't I create a very simply app that uses the web version of Facebook?"

SlimFacebook, with its 1.1Mb 680Kb and 0 Permissions, is the result!
Just made, anyone who has saw it want to download it so I've decided to upload it into the PlayStore and on Github to allow everyone to contribute.

In the first version of the app I've put only:

    go to the home;
    refresh the page;
    go on the top;
    open the actual page on the browser;
    open the app with facebook links;
    the external links are not opened in the app;
    nothing else.

Actually there aren't / TO-DO LIST:

    use share button to pubblish post;
    upload of the photo;
    geolocalizzation;
    custom javascript allert;
    multi windows (ex. home and messages);
    support to the main productor features (ex. Samsung popup);
    translations;
    things received from feedback.

I would also remove unused files to make the app lighter.

I'm looking for a feedback!
Anyone can help me, I'm open to collaboration!
