# SlimFacebook
I'm trying to buid a very light version of Facebook. Light not only in weight but also in the use.

I've built this app because I use Facebook a little and Facebook applications are too heavy compared to my use and use the mobile browser to go on m.Facebook.com was stressful and it ate battery and ram.

In my smartphone I wanted a version of Facebook that:
- has to hold little memory on the phone;
- hasn't to suck my battery;
- has to have only the necessary permissions.

In the first version of the app I've put only:
- refresh the page
- go on the top
- go to the home
- open the actual page on the browser 
and nothing else.

I think to add:
- use share button to pubblish post;
- upload of the photo;
- geolocalizzation;
- custom allert;
- multi windows (ex. home and messages);
- support to the main productor features (ex. Samsung popup);
- things received from feedback.

I'm looking for a feedback!
Anyone can help me, I'm open to collaboration!
